🚀 Full Stack Developer | Symfony/React 🛠️

Greetings! 👋 I'm Erwann, a Full Stack Developer. My expertise lies in harnessing the capabilities of Symfony and React to construct robust and scalable solutions.

📚 Passion for Knowledge Sharing:
Beyond my love for learning, I'm dedicated to sharing my insights. I've had the privilege of conducting advanced training sessions in France and abroad, including Barcelona. These sessions equip teams with the skills necessary to navigate the ever-evolving tech landscape. Among the topics covered, I delved into Symfony Messenger component and hexagonal architecture. Currently, I am actively involved in mentoring interns, finding immense satisfaction in witnessing their eyes light up as they discover and learn new things.

🔧 Infrastructure Enthusiast:
I thrive on overcoming infrastructure challenges. Whether it's designing scalable solutions, enhancing or setting up CI/CD pipeline.
